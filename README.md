# Epiphanous Design System

This work is heavily derivative of work by
[Brent Jackson](https://github.com/jxnblk), making
heaving use of [styled-system](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system) and its ideas. Thanks
to Brent for sharing his great work.

This repo contains something between a design system
and a boilerplate for a modern react web application.
I am using this as a place to evolve and test design
system ideas. Feel free to use it as you wish. If you
want to contribute ideas back, please feel free to 
fork and open a PR. Eventually, I'll add some further
guidelines on contributing, but for now, just use your
best judgement.
